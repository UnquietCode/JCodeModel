<h1>How to contribute to the Codemodel project </h1>
<p> This page describes the contribution process for the Codemodel project.  </p>
<h2> 0. Become a contributor </h2>
<p> Like many other open-source projects, the Codemodel project requires
  contributors to jointly assign their copyright on contributed code.  </p>
<p>If you
  haven't yet signed the <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/opensource/sca.pdf">Sun
    Contributor Agreement</a> (SCA) then please do so and fax it to
  +1-408-715-2540,
  or scan it and e-mail the result to
  sun_ca(at)sun.com. </p>
<p> The SCA gives Sun and the contributor joint copyright interests in the
  code.  The contributor retains copyrights while also granting those rights to
  Sun as the project sponsor.  You only need to sign the SCA once in order to
  cover all changes that you might contribute to any Sun-sponsored open-source
  project including not just the Codemodel project but also, for example, <a href="http://glassfish.dev.java.net/">GlassFish</a>, <a href="http://netbeans.org/">NetBeans</a>, and <a href="http://opensolaris.org/">OpenSolaris</a>.  If you've already signed the
  SCA in order to contribute to some other Sun-sponsored project then you do not
  need to sign it again in order to contribute to the Codemodel project. </p>
<p><strong>Request a  Role through <a href="http://java.net/projects/codemodel/roles">Role Request</a> link. </strong></p>
<h2> 1. Find something interesting to work on </h2>
<p> The most obvious thing to work on is a bug or enhancement (RFE) about which
  you are passionate.  Please check the &quot;gms&quot; category of the online <a href="http://java.net/jira/browse/CODEMODEL/">bug database</a> to see if your idea is already
  described there, and if so then use that bug/RFE's id number when writing about
  your work. </p>
<p> If you're interested in a particular area but don't have any specific ideas
  about what to do then feel free to post a query to the appropriate development
  list to ask for suggestions that match your skills and knowledge. </p>
<h2> 2. Discuss your intended change </h2>
<p> Before you invest time working on a change, discuss what you're trying to
  do with other engineers working on the same code.Use the Codemodel Dev alias at dev@codemodel.java.net</p>
<p>They're likely to be able to
  offer comments and suggestions for
  a smoother submission process.  Announcing that you're working on a particular
  item can also help to avoid wasted effort in case someone else is already
  working on it. </p>
<p> If you're thinking of working on an existing bug or RFE then the best way
  to start such a discussion is to post a message to the appropriate development
  list with a subject line of the form </p>
<blockquote><tt><span class="param">&lt;Issue Number&gt; </span>: <span class="param">My
  favorite bug/RFE synopsis </span></tt></blockquote>
<h2> 3. Submit a patch </h2>
<p> When your change is ready, send a message to the appropriate development
  list with a subject line of the form </p>
<blockquote><tt>[PATCH] <span class="param">&lt;Issue Number&gt;</span>: <span class="param">My favorite bug/RFE synopsis</span></tt></blockquote>
<p> If no existing bug or RFE describes your
  change then omit the id number</p>
<p> The message should contain three things, either directly in the body or as
  attachments: </p>
<ul>
  <li> A description of the change, including a rationale for your approach and
    a discussion of any alternative approaches that were considered, if relevant.
    If no existing bug or RFE describes your change then also include a
    description of the problem that it solves or the need that it
    addresses. </li>
  <li> Diffs of the code changes (cvs diff -u).  Be sure to identify the baseline version for
    your diffs by mentioning its build number (<tt>b02</tt>, <tt>b03</tt>, etc.),
    which you can find in the name of the source bundle you that started with.</li>
  <li> A unit test
    that validates your change.  The test should fail when run against a build
    without the change and succeed when run against a build with the change.
    Unit tests aren't always practical, but if practical then a unit test is required. </li>
</ul>
<h2>4. Contribute through Code Reviews, Site Content and Documentation</h2>
<p>Although much of the project code has associated javadoc comments, we welcome contributions where there aren't any. </p>
<p>We welcome code review comments posted through Issue Tracker or the Dev alias. </p>
<p>Any contributions for site content/maintenance and documentation of Project Codemodel is also most welcome.</p>
