JCodeModel is a fork of the existing Sun codemodel, part of the GlassFish project.
With java.net in ruins, it seemed liked a good time to fork this project and
clean it up as well as add some new features (for example, Java 7 syntax).

The current release is `1.0.3`, and contains several fixes, cosmetic improvements to
the output, and some improved functionality for inner classes to support the
development of [Flapi](https://github.com/UnquietCode/Flapi).

Many thanks to the original contributors, namely @Kohsuke.
